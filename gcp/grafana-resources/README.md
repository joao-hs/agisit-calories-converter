### Grafana Resources

These files will be added to the Grafana Docker container. This directory holds the necessary configuration files so that Grafana initializes with a running Dashboard.

> The dashboard "Node Stats" was entirely made by us. The configuration and provisioning of Grafana `.yaml` files was inspired by https://github.com/cirocosta/sample-grafana/.
